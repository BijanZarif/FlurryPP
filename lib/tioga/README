TIOGA - Topology Independent Overset Grid Assmebler

Functionality:
--------------

TIOGA can perform overset grid connectivity in 3-D between
multiple unstructured (or structured) meshes that are in a distributed
computing environment, i.e. each mesh is partitioned in to multiple
parts.

Limitations:
------------

(1) Each process must own only one partition
(2) Each partition should be homogeneous, i.e it should have parts of
    only one of the meshes

Notes:
------

TIOGA has unrestricted access to anyone since it was developed in the personal
time of the author. It is expected to serve as an academic/research 
counterpart for PUNDIT (which is the product of the CREATE A/V program
and is export controlled). TIOGA has a subset of the functionality of 
PUNDIT and is about 3x slower owing to the use of Alternating Digital Tree (ADT)
searches as the baseline point-location algorithm in places of the exact-inverse
map strategy used in PUNDIT.

TIOGA has options to perform fully consistent high-order connectivity using
call-back functions supplied by the the high-order code that are capable of doing
inclusion tests and basis-consistent interpolation given [r,s,t] location.
