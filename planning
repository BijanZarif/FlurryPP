Mesh refinement / adaptation
--Move all mesh functions to geo class
--Once some sensor implemented, pass to geo to refine cells
--Upon creating new elements, each new cell can link to "parent" cell to interpolate data to its solution points
  --More complicated if using Galerkin projection instead of collocation, but that can use superMesh once complete

As stated above - need to modify geo class to handle, well, all geo-related operations.  Better to have
a more global approach to many things, rather than having each ele handle it all.
For moving grids, after geo updates node positions & velocities, have each ele grab the new values

Face Classes
--Add a new 'mortar' class to handle different orders or split edges
  --See Lala's thesis for implementation details
